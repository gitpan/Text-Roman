DOCUMENTATION

Full documentation available in the POD.

NOTES

This module was originally written by Peter de Padua
Krauss <krauss@ifqsc.sc.usp.br> and submitted to CPAN by
Stanislaw Pusep <stanis@linuxmail.org> who has relinquished
control to me since the original author has never maintained
it and can no longer be reached.

I have completely rewritten the module, implementing simpler
algorithms to perform the same functionality, adding a test
suite, a Changes file, etc.  and providing more comprehensive
documentation.  Questions/suggestions regarding this module
can now come to me (see AUTHOR section in the docs).

WARNING

Be advised that this release supports the old interface to the
module but that it is now deprecated.  Please consult docs before using!
