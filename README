NOTES

I have completely rewritten this module, implementing simpler
algorithms to perform the same functionality, adding a test
suite, a Changes file, etc.  and providing more comprehensive
documentation.  For a history of the module and credits to others
involved please the the man page.  Questions/suggestions may 
now come to me (see AUTHOR section in the docs).
